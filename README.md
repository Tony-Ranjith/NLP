# NLP
Welcome to My NLP Repository, This repository contains my complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning journey, covering everything from basic text processing to advanced deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers. Each topic is explained with theory, code implementations, and projects to showcase real-world applications

# How to Use This Repository
- Each topic has its own folder containing practice notebooks.
- Follow the structured approach and explore notebooks to understand and implement NLP models.
- More topics and projects will be added as the learning progresses.

# Topics Covered
✅ Text Preprocessing

✅ Text Representation (BoW, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)

✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER)

✅ Text Classification

✅ Sequence Models (RNN, LSTM, GRU)

✅ Attention Mechanism

✅ Transformers (BERT, GPT)

✅ Advanced NLP Applications (Chatbots, Summarization, etc.)

# Goal of This Repository
- 📌 Build a strong foundation in NLP
- 📝 Upload practice notebooks under each topic
- 🚀 Implement real-world NLP projects

🔥 Let's explore NLP....!
